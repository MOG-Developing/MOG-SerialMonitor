# MOG-SerialMonitor

**What is MOG-SerialMonitor? It's a project by me to READ and WRITE in your COM ports**

__You can use it for your ESP and LOT development devices (it actually works with every device or microcontroller that appears as a com port).__

*Requirements: Python 3.11 or 3.11.9 (or any higher ones)*

**required libraries: pip install customtkinter pyserial threading**
_every library it uses: tkinter, threading, os, json, datetime, pyserial, serial, serial.tools.list_ports_
